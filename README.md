### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my FIRST project, a website for a friend who is a nutritionist.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python on Udemy, HTML, CSS and JavaScript in FreeCodeCamp and by doing my first project.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever I can!!!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning how to code properly, using the best practices and landing my first ever developer job.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about me! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Instagram: alexistm96 | Email: alexistm96@gmail.com | Shoot me a DM or an Email ;)
- :mortar_board: Fun fact: I'm a Mechatronics engineer and I have a Master's degree related to manufacturing and material's science... totally unrelated to programming, but I want to give developing a try at least :) 
- :runner: Hobbies: :muscle: I enjoy lifting weights a lot, a bit of calisthenics, :evergreen_tree: talking walks on nature, :dog2: walking my dogs, :headphones: and listening to podcasts.
