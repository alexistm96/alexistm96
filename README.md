### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my FIRST project, a website for a friend who is a nutritionist.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python on Udemy, HTML, CSS and JavaScript in FreeCodeCamp and by doing my first project.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever I can!!!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning how to code properly, using the best practices and landing my first ever developer job.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about me! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Instagram: alexistm96 | Email: alexistm96@gmail.com | Shoot me a DM or an Email ;)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Mechatronics engineer and I have a Master's degree related to manufacturing and material's science... totally unrelated to programming, but I want to give developing a try at least :)
